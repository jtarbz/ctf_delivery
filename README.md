# ctf_delivery
this is a framework for the easy creation and deployment of network-based ctf challenges. its aim is to allow for the inclusion of
remote boxes to cryptography or reverse-engineering oriented challenges, thus giving challenge creators more options. the inspiration
for this project was its utility in challenge creation for the inaugural calvert hall capture the flag competition.

# use
currently, the project exists in a barebones form; one will have to edit the `handle_client()` function in the source code in order
to achieve any sort of custom functionality. luckily, the structure lends itself easily to this purpose - simply write your own
operations and checks.
